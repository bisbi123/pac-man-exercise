# Eye Exercise
A simple exercise as part of MIT's Professional Certificate in Coding: Full Stack Development with MERN.
Another example getting us comfortable with the DOM and injecting items to the DOM. 
Some classic animation techniques used here such as checking the borders of the the web-page and dynamically reacting 
to an edge.

# To Run
Simply drop the index.html file on your favorite browser and look around.

# Future Development
I was hoping to get the actual images change when an edge was hit but the movement of the object would stop. Something to look at later on.
